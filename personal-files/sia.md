## Recipe
Here is my recipe that I would like to share:
### Ingredients
- 1 cup sugar
- 5 cups chopped walnuts
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 2 sticks butter, melted (only melt 1 at a time)
- 1 package filo dough
- 60 whole cloves
#### Syrup:
- 1 ¼ cup water
- 2 cups sugar
- 8 oz orange blossom honey
- 1 cinnamon stick
- Pieces of lemon and orange peel
### Instructions
1. First, prepare the syrup.  Combine syrup ingredients in a saucepan, and bring to a simmer.  Continue to cook until sugar is dissolved and coats the back of a spoon.  Let cool.  
2. Mix the first 3 ingredients together in a bowl.
3. With brush and melted butter, brush pan(s) until coated with melted butter (on the inside only, obviously).  Layer 5 sheets of filo, buttering each one before placing the next layer.  Next, sprinkle 1/3 of the walnut mixture on top of the filo.  Repeat this 2 more times, then finish with the final 5 sheets of filo (rolls of filo usually come with 20 sheets). 
4. Score (cut) the baklava into pieces.  For a 9x13 pan, I first cut into squares (3 by 5), then I cut triangles by halving the squares. Now stab each piece right through the heart with a clove.
5. Bake at 350 degrees until golden as if King Midas touched it himself, about 30 minutes.  
6. Pour syrup over hot baklava and let stand until all syrup is absorbed.  Then, fully cut the scored pieces and serve.  Show your American spirit by serving vanilla ice cream on top.
